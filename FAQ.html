          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <p><b>I submitted a story. When will I see it? </b>As soon as possible! We receive close to a hundred submissions every day. While many are great stories, only a few can make it on to the site.

We also ensure overly crude submissions, or those inciting hatred for whatever reason will not make the cut. We aim to keep the site at most a PG-13 environment; curse words will be starred out and occasional innuendos may pop up once in a while, but for the most part we don’t want to trigger any office internet filters!

That said, if your submission is genuinely funny or interesting and is in the good nature of the site you should see it soon. At the moment the backlog is about six weeks long, so be patient! If you really feel your submission is worthy of publishing then submit it again! It is entirely possible we just missed it the first time around.</p>

            <b>My story got published, but it’s slightly different! How come?</b> Sometimes we will need to edit a story slightly to make it suitable for publication. Scene-setting is great, but extraneous detail may need to be cut down a little. Your submission might explain that this didn’t happen to you but to your friend/sister/uncle, but the audience doesn’t need to know that.

If it isn’t important to the punch-line we’ll also remove reference to brand names, overly strong language, and overly long sentences.

Don’t worry, we still aim to keep the spirit of the story alive and ensure it remains as hilarious as ever!

            <b>Is this site suitable for children?</b>No. Some situations are not suitable for younger audiences. We do our best to censor profanity and other explicit content, but there are some topics that are best discussed only amongst adults and away from the prying eyes (and ears) of children.

            <b>Are your stories real?</b>As we’ve said, we receive up to a hundred submissions a day. Selecting the few that make it to the site is a long process, but even then the work isn’t done. Every submission that meets the grade is then put through search engines using multiple variations of key text.

In the past we have found submissions that are:
-Quotes from episodes of sitcoms (Family Guy being a continuous favorite!)
-Copy and paste jobs from other humor blogs
-Slightly amended tales from stand-up comedians
-Textual interpretations of YouTube clips

For obvious reasons, these submissions don’t make it to publication. Also for obvious reasons, those that do might have been copied from some other source that we missed, so if you spot something we haven’t then let us know!
