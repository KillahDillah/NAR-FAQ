          <p id="mefirst"><b>Not Always Right</b> is absurd & bizarre but true stories submitted by everyday people from around the world. </p>
          <p>Originally launched in 2007, Not Always Right focused on illogical & ludicrous customer stories (“The customer is NOT always right”). However, Not Always Right has since expanded to include anecdotes from all spheres of life.</p>
          <p> Not Always Right currently features stories about customers, bosses & coworkers, romance, family, school, friends & strangers, feel good, healthcare, and law.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Not Always Right</b> is a small team of eight. Our staff includes five hard-working: editors, two tech wizards, and the OG founder. We are based in the US, Canada, and the UK.</p>
