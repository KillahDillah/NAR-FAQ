          <b>What is this?</b>
          <p>Not Always Right features absurd & bizarre but true stories submitted by readers from around the world. When we originally launched in 2007, the site focused on funny & stupid customer stories (“The customer is NOT always right”). However, Not Always Right has since expanded to included anecdotes from all spheres of life.</p>
          <p> Not Always Right now features stories about customers, bosses & coworkers, romance, family, school, friends & strangers, feel good, healthcare, and law.</p>
          <br>
          <b>Who are we?</b>
          <p>Not Always Right is run by a small team of seven gals & guys. Our staff includes five hard-working editors, one tech wizard, and the original founder. We are based in the US, Canada, and the UK.</p>
